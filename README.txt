To use, extract Project vFinal, open Project folder, and run the Mars4_5.jar executable.

------ MAKE SURE that Settings --> "Initialize Global counter to global 'main' if defined" is checked before running -------

To run the game:

1. File --> Open --> select the main_program file within MARS4_5.jar

2. Compile the main_program frile, then hit "Run the current program" 

3. A short music tone will play, and then you will see the opening title scrawl for our game. After that, all instructions will be shown in game.


NOTE: Please exit the game through the in-game options: Press 0, then after the music plays, press "N" or "n" to exit the game.	
      If you do not exit the game properly, you may run into errors, such as an incorrect stack pointer, or variables that will not load.

      If this error occurs, close MARS, reopen, and reopen and recompile the main_program
